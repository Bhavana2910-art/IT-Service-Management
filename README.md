IT Operations Control Tower – ITSM Performance & SLA Compliance Dashboard (Power BI)
 Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end IT Service Management (ITSM) analytics solution using Power BI to monitor IT operations performance. The dashboard provides a centralized view of ticket trends, SLA compliance, resolution efficiency, backlog status, and workload distribution across departments and regions.

The goal of this project is to help IT leadership and service delivery teams make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency, enhance service quality, and reduce SLA breaches.

>> Business Problem:-

In many organizations, ITSM reporting is often tool-based and highly operational, making it difficult for senior management to get a consolidated performance view. Manual reporting through Excel is time-consuming and lacks drill-down capabilities.

This project solves that challenge by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides executive-level KPIs and detailed operational insights.

>>Project Objective :-

To develop a centralized dashboard that enables IT management to track and monitor key ITSM KPIs including:

Total ticket volume and trends

Open vs closed ticket backlog

SLA compliance and breach tracking

Priority-wise resolution time performance

Workload distribution across support teams

High-frequency categories and recurring issue patterns

Key Dashboard Modules:-

The dashboard includes the following key reporting sections:

1️⃣ Executive Summary Dashboard

Total Tickets Raised

Open vs Resolved Tickets

SLA Compliance Rate (%)

SLA Breached Tickets

Average Resolution Time (Hours)

Backlog and Service Health Indicators

2️⃣ Incident & Service Request Analysis

Ticket volume by type (Incident, Request, Problem, Change)

Monthly and yearly ticket trends

Region and department-based ticket distribution

Peak workload period identification

3️⃣ SLA & Resolution Performance

SLA Met vs SLA Breached breakdown

Priority-wise SLA breach analysis

Resolution time by priority level (P1–P4)

Ticket aging insights

4️⃣ Team & Workload Analytics

Ticket assignment by support group / owner group

Workload distribution comparison

Productivity and efficiency trends across teams

5️⃣ Category & Root Cause Analytics

Ticket distribution by category and subcategory

Identification of recurring issue categories

Root cause pattern analysis for problem management

 Dataset Information

The project uses historical ITSM ticket datasets containing:

Ticket ID

Ticket Type (Incident, Request, Problem, Change)

Ticket Status (Open, Closed, In Progress, Scheduled, Cancelled)

Priority (P1, P2, P3, P4)

SLA Status (Met / Breached)

Resolution Time (Hours)

Ticket Category / Subcategory


 Tools & Technologies Used

🔹 Tools

Power BI Desktop

Power BI Service (Publishing & Refresh – optional)

Microsoft Excel / CSV Extracts

🔹 Technologies & Concepts

Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)

Data Modeling (Star Schema)

DAX (Measures & KPI Calculations)

Interactive slicers, drill-down & filtering

Key DAX Measures Implemented

Some important calculated KPIs built using DAX include:

Total Tickets Raised

Open Tickets / Closed Tickets

SLA Compliance Rate (%)

SLA Breach Count
Tickets by Category / Region / Department

Key Insights Generated (Top Findings)

SLA compliance was observed around 67%, indicating improvement opportunities in service delivery and escalation handling.

P1/P2 tickets contributed a higher resolution workload despite lower ticket volume, impacting team bandwidth.


>>**Business Impact / Results** :-

Reduced manual reporting effort by ~60–70%, saving approximately 4–5 hours per week for IT operations leads.

Improved SLA breach visibility and tracking, reducing untracked SLA breaches by ~15% through proactive monitoring.

Reduced monthly performance reporting time from 1–2 days to minutes, improving governance review efficiency.

Identified high-impact categories contributing nearly 55–65% of ticket load, supporting problem management in permanent fixes.

Enabled workload optimization across teams, improving average resolution efficiency by ~8–12% during peak periods.

>>**Dashboard Output** :-

The final Power BI dashboard provides interactive visuals including:

SLA Compliance KPIs

Ticket Trend Line Charts

Ticket Type Distribution (Incidents, Requests, Problems, Changes)

Priority vs Resolution Time Comparison

SLA Met vs Breached Breakdown

Category and Department-level Ticket Analysis

Workload Distribution by Owner Group

>>** Conclusion** :-

This project successfully delivers an ITSM Operations Control Tower dashboard that improves visibility into IT service performance. It supports IT leadership in tracking SLA compliance, monitoring backlog, optimizing team workload, and identifying recurring issue categories for proactive improvements.

Overall, the dashboard strengthens service governance and enables data-driven decision-making across IT operations.
